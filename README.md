vectfit.py
==========

Duplication of the [Fast Relaxed Vector-Fitting algorithm](http://www.sintef.no/Projectweb/VECTFIT/) in python.

To use, put vectfit.py somewhere on your path.

Then, from the command line, you can run:
```
python test_vectfit_auto.py
```
which will fit to a noisy measurement of a scipy generated filter and also plot the residuals.
